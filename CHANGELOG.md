# AllTheThings

## [SL-2.3.7](https://github.com/DFortun81/AllTheThings/tree/SL-2.3.7) (2021-07-07)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DFortun81/AllTheThings/compare/SL-2.3.6...SL-2.3.7) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/DFortun81/AllTheThings/releases)

### Tip of the day

You can right-click practically everything in ATT lists and it will open new window, often with more information about the Thing!

### Another tip of the day

You can Alt+right-click some things to plot coordinates to them, this should work with quests, NPCs, treasures, etc. We support both TomTom and game navigation system.

### Notable changes:

- To help viewing Tier Tokens (and other Currency-type Items) while in Account Mode, the Class constraint of any Contained Thing will additionally be shown next to that Thing in the tooltip
- Lots of items from WoD+ that had their required level in ATT set to 100+ were fixed. This should help people playing with "Filter Things By Level" on. Unfortunatelly, some items still report high levels (even when you can get them from level 10 using Timewalking Campaigns), nothing we can do about this. However, there shouldn't be any items "requiring" level 60+ anymore but Free Trial characters are still screwed.
- We will now group together treasures that have same loot while still alowing you to see if you looted individual chests. Plotting coordinates to the whole group of objects still works. You can see this in action in Maw/Korthia.
- Overall slight decrease in memory usage on start up depending on loaded Zone (~3-5%). Popout windows now require slightly less memory as well.
- Fixed rare errors when learning new mounts/flight points
- Fixed an issue where the minilist would not populate sometimes
- More rare/Adventure drops, treasure/rare coordinates/descriptions, recipes, etc
- Harvested more items (Tazavesh, etc)
- Added Death's Advance and The Archivist's Codex to the Factions section
- Various fixes
