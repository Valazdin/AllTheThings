### Highlight of this update

#### Xyraxz's Controlling Rod

Xyraxz's Controlling Rod was finally added to the addon, thanks everyone for reporting it!

#### Fixes!

Lots of post-9.1 release fixes including but not limited to:

- huge lag on login, rendering the game unplayable for a long period of time
- empty tooltip for paragon rewards in currency tab
- broken Mark of Honor window

### Other notable changes:

- Added an auto-quest refresh which will trigger after looting & leaving combat (Please let us know if this causes any noticeable lag! Can turn it into a setting otherwise)
- Fixed Quest Chain Requirements from sometimes cutting-off when the quest switches from faction-specific to Neutral quests and vice versa
- Various small 9.1 updates: drops, quests, coords, recipes, adventure rewards, etc
- Ongoing conversion of cost/token items to new format
- More performance improvements (profession lists, raid assistant, etc)
- Slight adjustment to waypoint plotting via TomTom to only plot visible groups which the player is not 'saved' to, unless it is the specific Thing which was clicked
- Marked 'Fel-Smelter' and 'Mass Obliteration' achievements as unobtainable and moved them to legacy. RIP anyone who didn't get them
- More stuff like treasure names should be localized now
- Various fixes to old content
