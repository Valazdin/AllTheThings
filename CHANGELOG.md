### Highlight of this update

#### Chains of Domination â›“

The long wait is over! After 218 days of 9.0 the first major patch of Shadowlands has arrived and we have updated ATT accordingly.

New zone, questlines, achievements, mounts and everything else should be in this patch but you can expect a new update over the weekend (Tazavesh and fixes).

### Other notable changes:

- Currencies now use new diamond icon instead of star icon (to avoid confusion with CanIMogIt)
- If you right-click a Thing to open popout window for it, we will now show Source(s) header with Vendors/Quests/etc
- Modified Contains & Search logic to properly utilize the 'Ignore BoE Filters' option for the nested content of BoE Items
- Ongoing fixes for stuff from Burning Crusade
- Fixed a bug causing script timeouts in some maps
- Lots of quest fixes/additions by Darkal (and others!)
- Now when you complete a quest that we think is not in a game we will ask you to report it
- Descriptions should no longer be duplicated (we fixed this at least twice before)
- PvP fixes
- Different fixes for window updates (when you complete quests, when you learn recipes, etc)
- Various fixes
