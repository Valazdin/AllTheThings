Kil'jaeden's Legion ship has crashed here near the Xenedar.\n\nThe once prosperous eredar civilizations that dotted these hills have crumbled away and vanished under the Legion's defilement. Jagged, dark rocks protrude from the fel tainted groves. The Legion's own creations stick out of the land almost like the rocks themselves. Trees, vitiated of any living essence are strewn throughout the land. Almost no flora has endured the planet's harsh conditions. Only black soil, devoid of life, covers the planet.",
