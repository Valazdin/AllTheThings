Following the destruction that befell Argus, the city of Mac'Aree now floats above the planet, in a relatively pristine state.\n\nMac'Aree's hills were purple, and its rivers glittered even in complete darkness. The city's walkways were lined with precious minerals. Jessera of Mac'Aree cannot remember anymore how long it has been since he last was there. The eredar prior to their corruption by Sargeras seemed to have a great love and reverence for Mac'Aree, as expressed on the inscription at the bottom of |cFFFFD700[The Last Relic of Argus]|r, 'I long for Mac'Aree'.",
