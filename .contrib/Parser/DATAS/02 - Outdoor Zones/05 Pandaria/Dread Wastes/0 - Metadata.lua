Separated from the rest of Pandaria by the Serpent's Spine constructed during the rule of Lei Shen, the Dread Wastes are the home of the Mantid. The landscape is dotted with massive Kypari trees that produce the amber which the Mantid utilize in many ways. Klaxxi'vess serves as the main quest hub for the zone, but there are two Pandaren settlements, Soggy's Gamble and Sunset Brewgarden, that provide additional quests and are necessary for unlocking all of the Paragons.",
