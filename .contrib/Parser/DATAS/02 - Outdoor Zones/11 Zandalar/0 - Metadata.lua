This would lead the Zandalari themselves to attempt to forge a new nation in other parts of the world to escape their compromised home, though they were largely unsuccessful at the time.\n\nNot as strong as in times past, beset by internal troubles within Zandalar itself, and amidst another war with the Alliance, the trolls of Zandalar now seek fresh allies, setting the ancient island up as a major theater for the impending Battle for Azeroth.",
