The islands are home to the human nation of the same name, having originally been discovered and colonized by Gilnean sailors from the mainland Eastern Kingdoms.\nKul Tiras has played host to a mighty naval tradition ever since its first settling by humans. During the Second War, it was the largest maritime force in Azeroth and a major center for the war effort against the Orcish Horde. Since then, and with the eventual disintegration of the Alliance of Lordaeron, Kul Tiras became significantly more isolated and less involved on the world stage.\nKul Tiras would once again return to prominence at the time of the Battle for Azeroth, when the Alliance ventured to the island to enlist the aid of the potent Kul Tiran navy in their new war against the Horde.",
